  content: "**Wildlife Bank is an An open-source initiative to keep the count on the population of endangered species left.
  It is platform a bit inspired from Google Earth & World meter as combination of both. Where people
  can gain education about species and also can know about their numbers too in real time. Also, people here can
  report wildlife crime or death of the animal and people can read about. It will be like maintain an
  information/reporting bank or library of animals. Also people here can report any wildlife animal they
  spotted outside their zone through our WildlifeSpot feature so that we can inform concern authority. Apart from

- title: Why?
  content: "> **\"The lack of wildlife data today creates severe limitations when it comes to analysing,
  mitigating and predicting problems and solutions in biodiversity conservation space. Any
  company or organisation today is required to submit financial data, labour data, and as of
  2022,climate data is gaining momentum as well. However, industries today have no
  incentive to measure how their operation affects biodiversity. By creating a data
  infrastructure to measure and analyse this data, wildlife can provide the tools to measure
  wildlife conservation impact and create data driven incentives for stronger action to act on
  biodiversity at an industrial level.\"**\n"
- title: ' Future Focus'
  content:  "> **\"Wildlife bank will be India's first centralized data library for Flora and Fauna, with the vision of hosting 
  over 1.6 million species nationwide, creating a bedrock of data analysis, insights and policy for Wildlife conservation at a national scale.\"**\n"
